# Day 10: Functions in Python

Today I learned:

- What functions are and why we use them
- How to define, call, and reuse a function
- How to use inputs (parameters) in functions
- How to return outputs using `return`

## Practice Exercises:
- Created simple greeting and math functions
- Learned how to take input and return results
- Practiced writing clean, reusable code

## Portfolio Mini Project:
### Basic Calculator
A calculator that can:
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide (with zero check)

This helps me understand how real apps break problems into reusable parts.
